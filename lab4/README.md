**Task:** in accordance with the variant, solve a nonlinear equation using the chord method and create a program that solves the equation "2*lg(x) - x/2 + 1 = 0". The program should take the interval on which to find the solution of the equation and the accuracy. The program should output the solutions of the equation and the graph of the equation.

The program is written in Python using Tkinter to create the GUI, NumPy and Matplotlib to draw graphs.
